# Security

I take the security of my software products and services seriously, including [Lithium 5](https://github.com/NoahDomingues/Lithium).

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of my open source repositories, you can report it to me privately via [email](mailto:noahsdom@gmail.com).

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Thanks for helping make my software safe for everyone.
