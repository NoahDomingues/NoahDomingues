## Who I am

Hi, and welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm Noah, I'm an indie music artist, student, writer, photographer and graphic designer. I also enjoy developing software, which is what my GitHub is for.

I am the founder of the **[Lithium Project](https://github.com/NoahDomingues/Lithium)**, an open-source custom Android-based operating system built for MediaTek devices. My mission is to give users the _freedom_ over their own devices, without manufacturer control or surveillance. I also maintain a few other projects, notably **[OFP Extractor](https://github.com/NoahDomingues/OFP-Extractor)** - a tool that enables users to unpack the game files of _Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising_ and _Operation Flashpoint: Red River_.

If you like any of my software, you are welcome to contribute where you can by making pull requests - or if you'd like to use my code or collaborate with me, feel free!
